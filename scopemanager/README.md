# scopemanager
The code in this directory was written by Jason Goodman at Wheaton College (MA). https://github.com/goodmanj/scopemanager

Remote telescope control software for Meade and Celestron scopes.

Need to prune this directory significantly. There are many files I assume are useless (pycache, log, etc...)
